## (Euro S&P)

**Submission deadline 22 September 2021 (Wednesday)**

**Conference: 6 - 10 June 2022, Genoa, Italy**

The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is the
European sibling conference of the IEEE Symposium on Security and
Privacy ("Oakland") conference. It is a premier forum for computer
security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and
bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously
unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security
or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that
systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of
applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers
that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient
promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning
widely-held beliefs. This year we are expanding the scope of the
symposium to include economic, ethical, legal, and social aspects and
interdependencies of computer security and privacy, and especially
encourage submissions that address global aspects of computer security
and privacy, including issues particular to parts of the world and
communities that are often neglected. We are including experts in
these areas in the program committee to ensure that such papers will
receive high-quality reviews from well-qualified reviewers.
